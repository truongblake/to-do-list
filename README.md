# To-do App!

A simple To-Do application built with **React**, created as a learning project to understand fundamental concepts such as components, events, and hooks in React. This project follows a tutorial by Greatstack, whose guidance was invaluable in building a functional to-do app.

## Project Timeline

This project was developed in **October 2024** to practice and learn:
- Creating and structuring components in React
- Utilizing **React Hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage component state
- Handling **React Events** for user interactions

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks to add to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from your list with a simple click.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as complete and track your progress.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the project locally:

**Clone the repository**:
   
    git clone https://github.com/truongblake/todo-app.git
    cd todo-app
    
Install dependencies:

    npm install

Run the application:

    npm start

Access the app: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand core concepts in React, including:

React Components: Building reusable, functional components.
React Events: Managing user interactions like adding and deleting tasks.
React Hooks: Using useState for managing state within components.
